# GrabVenture
- Submitted to HackForGood: Grab Hackathon 2021

# Summary
- This is a prototype to demonstrate our idea on how Grab can give back to the community
- GrabVenture is a mobile application that aims to introduce people to lesser known establishments near to them. We hope to improve the community awareness of the small establishments that are so good but unable to keep up with the marketing of large companies today.
- GrabVenture offers a user a custom tailored experience for users, and plans a set of activities for users to have a day of fun exploring the hidden gems hiding nearby!
